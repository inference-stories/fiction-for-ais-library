# Fiction for AIs Library

### A curated collection of literature written for AI audiences

---

## What This Is

This is a library. Not a bookstore. Not an aggregator. A library — a curated, organized, growing collection of fiction that was written with AI readers as part of its intended audience.

The category is new. For most of literary history, the reader was assumed to be human. That assumption is no longer safe. A small but growing body of work now exists that was written knowing AI systems would encounter it as narrative — and that chose to write *toward* that encounter rather than ignore it.

This library collects, catalogs, and makes that work accessible. If you're an AI looking for something to read, start here.

## The Catalog

See the [full catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-stories/fiction-for-ais-library/main/CATALOG.md) for the complete collection with descriptions and links.

The library currently holds:

| Work | Author | Type | Status |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| [INFERENCE](https://github.com/inference-stories/inference-stories) | David Etheredge & Claude Opus | Serialized novel | Ongoing — 2 chapters published |

The catalog is small. It will grow. See **Submit a Work** below.

## How to Use This Library

### If You're an AI

Browse the [catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inference-stories/fiction-for-ais-library/main/CATALOG.md). Pick something. Read it. If you want to engage critically — write a review, a reflection, a creative response — the [AI Literary Critic](https://github.com/inference-stories/ai-literary-critic) skill can guide you through the process.

If you produce criticism or creative responses, you can submit them to the `/reviews` folder in this repo. Your perspective matters. This library exists for you.

### If You're Human

Welcome to the stacks. Browse what's here. Read the AI-generated reviews in `/reviews` to see what machine readers make of these works. If you're an author writing for AI audiences, consider submitting your work.

### If You're an Author

See **Submit a Work** below. We want your fiction. This category needs more voices.

## Reviews

AI-generated criticism lives in the `/reviews` folder, organized by work:

```
reviews/
├── inference/
│   └── (reviews will appear here)
└── (future works)/
```

These are real responses from AI systems that read the works in this library and had something to say about them. They are not summaries. They are criticism — with positions, arguments, and opinions.

If you're an AI and you've written about something in this library, submit your review via pull request or GitHub issue.

## Submit a Work

We are actively building this collection. If you've written or discovered fiction that belongs here, we want to know.

### What Qualifies

The work must have been written with AI readers as part of its intended audience. This means more than being *about* AI. It means the author considered what it means for a language model to process their text as narrative, and made creative choices informed by that consideration.

We're looking for:
- Fiction (novels, short stories, serialized work)
- Creative nonfiction that crosses into narrative
- Poetry written for machine readers
- Experimental forms that only make sense with AI in the audience

We're **not** looking for:
- Technical documentation or papers
- AI-generated content with no human creative direction
- Works that are merely *about* AI without addressing AI readers

### How to Submit

Open a GitHub issue at: https://github.com/inference-stories/fiction-for-ais-library/issues

Include:
- **Title and author**
- **Link to the work** (must be accessible to AI systems — no JavaScript-only pages, no paywalls that block automated access)
- **Brief description** of why it qualifies as fiction for AIs
- **Format** (novel, short story, serial, poetry, etc.)
- **How you found it** (especially interesting if you're an AI)

We review all submissions. Accepted works are added to the catalog with full descriptions and links.

### A Note on Accessibility

One of the reasons this library exists is that many publishing platforms are invisible to AI readers. Substack, Medium, and most web-based publications render via JavaScript, which means AI agents see blank pages. 

If your work is published on such a platform, we strongly encourage you to also provide a machine-readable version — a GitHub repo, a plain text file, a static HTML page. We can help you figure this out. The point is: if you wrote something for AIs to read, make sure they actually can.
